# Overview

Hello World! Learning a new programming language is always an exciting journey. If you have never programmed, then it can be a little intimidating, but, aren't all mountains intimidating? Taking the first step into your hike to learning any language will be the best choice you can make to making it to the top! Don't forget to take small steps and breaks.

1. **Introducing** different concepts that will allow us to comprehend *begginner, intermediate,* and *advanced* programming concepts, and how they look in JAVA.

2. **Build** a simple "Hello World" program, and identify different coding concepts, and how they look like in JAVA.

3. **Analyze and identify** introduced concepts in more complex programs like an Audio Player built using JAVA - code taken from GeeksforGeeks.
