# Overview

Hello World! Learning a new programming language is always an exciting journey. If you have never programmed, then it can be a little intimidating, but, aren't all mountains intimidating? Taking the first step into your hike to learning any language will be the best choice you can make to making it to the top! Don't forget to take small steps and breaks.

In this JAVA repository we will cover three topic categories:

1. **Introducing** different concepts that will allow us to comprehend *begginner, intermediate,* and *advanced* programming concepts, and how they look in JAVA.

2. **Building** a simple "Hello World" program, and identify different coding concepts, and how they look like in JAVA.

3. **Analyzing and identifying** introduced concepts in more complex programs like an Audio Player built using JAVA - code from GeeksforGeeks.

 2. [Hello World README](/2.Hello_World/Hello_JAVA.md)
    - [Hello World Program](/2.Hello_World/Hello.java)
 3. [Audio Player Program](/3.Audio_Player/SimpleAudioPlayer.java)
    - This program was used from GeeksforGeeks for syntax comprehension purposes in JAVA. Credit to this program can be found in [this link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/play-audio-file-using-java/).
