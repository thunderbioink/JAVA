<h1>HELLO WORLD with JAVA</h1>

When you learn ANY programming language, I highly suggest creating a "Hello World" Program. You can introduce yourself with very basic yet important aspects of the language by just building this beginners program.


A few items to consider a part of JAVA in this program:

1. You will need two files:
    - A file ending in *".java"*
    - A second file ending in *".class"*

    *The result will be the following:*

2. This *"Hello World"* program will use a class, a method, a string, and print statement:
    - Notice the structure for the program. 
    - Don't forget your semi-colon *";"* at the end of your statement.

    *If you are familiar with C/C++ you will want to remember that semi-colon.*

3. Run your program and observe the beautiful OUTPUT of your string "Hello World!":
