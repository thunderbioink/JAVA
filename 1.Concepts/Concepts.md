# Classes

On other websites and books you will learn that creating a class file for all of your programs is not necessary. I did this to smooth the RUN process for my JAVA files. You can [read this article](https://exlskills.com/learn-en/courses/introduction-to-java-intro_to_java/introduction-to-java-SikwrMAuJQHg/java-class-and-source-file-KTjwapEIQlNC/java-class-file-NEYuXtFFhjfu) on the importance on extension files for you JAVA programs.

Simply put, it allows the JAVA Virtual Machine to convert your JAVA program to Machine Code so your OS can read it. In the article above you can find other formats that don't end in *".class"*.'

How this looks like in this repository:

Now, extension files are different from classes that encapsulate your main methods. Here's a basic class structure:
-  **IMPORTANT**, if you try and run the program written like this, you won't be able to see the OUTPUT of your variables printed on the terminal.
- Try and observe why this code would OUTPUT an error. *Clue given in image.*

# Methods
 
Methods in JAVA hold the arguments you will be using for your Program. In the example we are reviewing, we can't just define "String[]" and call it good. 

Observe, we are using other type of variables in addition to STRINGS.

This is how a properly initialized Method looks like in the programs used in this repository:

# Variables

There are different types of variables in JAVA. Observe the following examples on how to declare them:

This is the Output for this simple program:

Now that you have dived into basic concepts in JAVA, yyou will be able to feel more comfortable understanding more complex programs, and continue your journey with JAVA.
